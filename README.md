## Installation
This application requires NPM installation of Express and UUID.
## Usage
Users will write, save, and delete notes through an express backend by saving and retrieving data from a JSON file. Once the application is executed, users will access the note taker through localhost:8080. Users can click the pencil icon to create a new note with a title and body of text, and then click the save icon to save the note to a JSON file. All saved notes will be displayed by their titles on the sidebar, and can be quickly accessed by clicking on them. Users can delete these notes by clicking the red delete icon next to the title in the sidebar.
